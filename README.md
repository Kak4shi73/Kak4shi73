🧩 I build tools that are clean in code and loud in impact.  
🧠 Crafting intuitive systems that just work — with precision, not clutter.  
⚔️ Known in the code world as *Kakashi* — quiet operator, surgical execution.

🚧 Currently focusing on:
- 🛠️ Automation & AI tools (`RankBlaze.in`)  
- 🌐 Chrome Extensions & Devtools  
- 🔥 Firebase & Scalable Real-Time Systems

🧭 Tech stack that feels like home:  
`React` • `Next.js` • `TailwindCSS` • `Node.js` • `Firebase` • `MongoDB`

🕶 Personal Code Philosophy:  
> *Clean UI. Smarter UX. Zero noise. Pure function.*
